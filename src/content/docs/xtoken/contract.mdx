First, head over to [this GitHub template](https://github.com/akshatcoder-hash/xToken) and create a new repository using it.

Clone the repository and set up the starter code in your workspace:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:<your username>/xToken.git
cd xToken/
npm i
```

Don't worry about the deployment scripts and tests; we've got you covered. üéâ Now, let's get to the fun part‚Äîbridging tokens!

**Step 1**: Setting Up the Basics üìù

Kick things off by declaring the license and importing the necessary libraries:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity ^0.8.13;
import "wormhole-solidity-sdk/WormholeRelayerSDK.sol";
```

Just like in our [Cross Chain Mailbox tutorial](https://startonwormhole.vercel.app/automatic-relayers/intro/), we're using the `wormhole-solidity-sdk` for seamless cross-chain functionality.

**Step 2**: Crafting the Function Signature üõ†Ô∏è

Now, let's define the function that will handle the cross-chain deposit quotes:

```solidity
   function quoteCrossChainDeposit(uint16 targetChain) public view returns (uint256 cost) {
// Function Body
 }
```


This function is public and read-only, meaning it won't alter the blockchain's state. It accepts a `uint16` parameter, `targetChain`, and returns a `uint256` variable named `cost`.

**Step 3**: Introducing Local Variables üì¶

```solidity
uint256 deliveryCost;
```

Within the function, go ahead and declare a local variable named `deliveryCost` of type `uint256`. This variable will store the expense associated with transferring the token and payload to the designated chain.

**Step 4**: Fetch the Delivery Cost üì¨

```solidity
(deliveryCost,) = wormholeRelayer.quoteEVMDeliveryPrice(targetChain, 0, GAS_LIMIT);
```


Utilize the `quoteEVMDeliveryPrice` method from the `wormholeRelayer` object to fetch the delivery cost. This function requires three arguments: `targetChain`, `0`, and `GAS_LIMIT`. The result will be stored in `deliveryCost`.

**Step 5**: Crunching the Numbers for Total Cost üßÆ

Now, let's compute the total cost of the cross-chain deposit by summing up `deliveryCost` and `wormhole.messageFee()`.

```solidity
function quoteCrossChainDeposit(uint16 targetChain) public view returns (uint256 cost) {
  uint256 deliveryCost;
   (deliveryCost,) = wormholeRelayer.quoteEVMDeliveryPrice(targetChain, 0, GAS_LIMIT);
   cost = deliveryCost + wormhole.messageFee();
}
```

**Step 6**: Function Signature and Cost Calculation üñãÔ∏è

Begin by setting the function signature to `public payable` and outline its parameters. Then, invoke the `quoteCrossChainDeposit` function to obtain the total cost for the cross-chain deposit.

```solidity
function sendCrossChainDeposit(
    uint16 targetChain,
    address targetHelloToken,
    address recipient,
    uint256 amount,
    address token
) public payable {
    uint256 cost = quoteCrossChainDeposit(targetChain);
}
```

Use the `require` statement to confirm that the Ether sent (`msg.value`) aligns with the quoted cost. This validation ensures that the user has dispatched the accurate amount of Ether to cover the transaction fees.

```solidity
require(msg.value == cost, "msg.value must be quoteCrossChainDeposit(targetChain)");
```

**Step 7**: Token Transfer and Payload Encoding üîÑ

```solidity
IERC20(token).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
```

Leverage the `transferFrom` function from the `IERC20` interface to move tokens from the sender to this contract. Next, encode the `recipient` address into bytes using `abi.encode`.

```solidity
bytes memory payload = abi.encode(recipient);
```

**Step 8**: Sending Tokens and Payload to Target Chain üöÄ

```solidity
sendTokenWithPayloadToEvm(
   targetChain, 
   targetHelloToken,
   payload, 
   0,
   GAS_LIMIT, 
   token,
  amount
);
```

Utilize the `sendTokenWithPayloadToEvm` function to dispatch the token and payload to the destination chain. Pass in all the necessary parameters like `targetChain`, `targetHelloToken`, `payload`, `0` for receiver value, `GAS_LIMIT`, `token`, and `amount`.

**Step 9**: Internal Function with Security Measures üõ°Ô∏è

```solidity
function receivePayloadAndTokens(
   bytes memory payload,
   TokenReceived[] memory receivedTokens,
   bytes32, // sourceAddress
   uint16,  // sourceChain
   bytes32  // deliveryHash
) internal override onlyWormholeRelayer {
   require(receivedTokens.length == 1, "Expected 1 token transfers");
   }
```

Declare the function as `internal` and `override`, and specify its parameters. Add the `onlyWormholeRelayer` modifier to make sure that only the Wormhole Relayer can invoke this function. Use a `require` statement to validate that only a single token transfer occurs in the `receivedTokens` array.

**Step 10**: Decoding Payload and Final Transfer üì¶

```solidity
address recipient = abi.decode(payload, (address));
```

Decode the `payload` to retrieve the `recipient` address using `abi.decode`. Then, execute the `transfer` function from the `IERC20` interface to send the received token to the designated recipient.

```solidity
IERC20(receivedTokens[0].tokenAddress).transfer(recipient, receivedTokens[0].amount);
```

And finally close your contract with a `}`.

If everything's been good so far, here's what your final code should look like:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

import "wormhole-solidity-sdk/WormholeRelayerSDK.sol";

contract HelloToken is TokenSender, TokenReceiver {
    uint256 constant GAS_LIMIT = 250_000;

    constructor(address _wormholeRelayer, address _tokenBridge, address _wormhole)
        TokenBase(_wormholeRelayer, _tokenBridge, _wormhole)
    {}

    function quoteCrossChainDeposit(uint16 targetChain) public view returns (uint256 cost) {
        // Cost of delivering token and payload to targetChain
        uint256 deliveryCost;
        (deliveryCost,) = wormholeRelayer.quoteEVMDeliveryPrice(targetChain, 0, GAS_LIMIT);

        // Total cost: delivery cost + cost of publishing the 'sending token' wormhole message
        cost = deliveryCost + wormhole.messageFee();
    }

    function sendCrossChainDeposit(
        uint16 targetChain,
        address targetHelloToken,
        address recipient,
        uint256 amount,
        address token
    ) public payable {
        uint256 cost = quoteCrossChainDeposit(targetChain);
        require(msg.value == cost, "msg.value must be quoteCrossChainDeposit(targetChain)");

        IERC20(token).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);

        bytes memory payload = abi.encode(recipient);
        sendTokenWithPayloadToEvm(
            targetChain, 
            targetHelloToken, // address (on targetChain) to send token and payload to
            payload, 
            0, // receiver value
            GAS_LIMIT, 
            token, // address of IERC20 token contract
            amount
        );
    }

    function receivePayloadAndTokens(
        bytes memory payload,
        TokenReceived[] memory receivedTokens,
        bytes32, // sourceAddress
        uint16,
        bytes32 // deliveryHash
    ) internal override onlyWormholeRelayer {
        require(receivedTokens.length == 1, "Expected 1 token transfers");

        address recipient = abi.decode(payload, (address));

        IERC20(receivedTokens[0].tokenAddress).transfer(recipient, receivedTokens[0].amount);
    }
}
```
