When it comes to crafting DeFi apps, you've got two main blueprints to choose from: 📐

1. **The Point-to-Point Model** 🔄
2. **The Hub and Spoke Model** 🎡

For our cross-chain borrow-lend app, we're going with the Hub and Spoke model. But before we dive into that, let's get a quick rundown of both! 🏃‍♀️

#### 🎯 **Understanding the Point-to-Point Model** 🎯

In the Point-to-Point universe, here's what you need to know:

- **Chain Autonomy 🌐**: Every chain is its own boss! They all have the same functions and can operate solo, without needing a central hub to hold their hand. 🤲

- **Peer-to-Peer Accounting 📊**: No middleman needed here! Chains can directly keep tabs on each other's transactions. It's like having a direct chat instead of a group conversation. 🗨️

- **Home is Where the Asset Is 🏠**: Your assets stay put on their native chains. No need to wrap them up or change their form to interact with other chains. 🛒

- **Wormhole Chit-Chat 🪐**: The system uses Wormhole messages as the main line of communication between chains. These messages keep everyone on the same page, making sure the accounting across chains is in sync. 🔄


And there you have it! Below is a schematic to help you visualize this design: 📊

#### 🤔 **Challenges with the Point-to-Point Model** 🤔

The point-to-point model sounds great, but it's not all sunshine and rainbows. 🌦️ Here are some hurdles you might face:

- **Rollercoaster Interest Rates 🎢**: When you've got assets and accounting all over the place, keeping track of ever-changing interest rates can get tricky.

- **Timing Troubles ⏱️**: Without a central hub to keep things in sync, you might run into timing issues, especially if Wormhole messages aren't processed right away.

- **Scattered Liquidity 💦**: Your liquidity could end up like puzzle pieces scattered across multiple chains, making things less efficient and user-friendly.


#### 🎡 **Exploring the Hub Model** 🎡

Switching gears, let's talk about the hub-and-spoke model. Here, the hub is the star of the show, acting as the central accounting or liquidity manager. 🌟

Different spokes (think of them as mini-chains or apps) chat with the hub, sending either accounting updates or wrapped tokens when there's movement. 📨

Why go for the hub model? Well, it's got some perks:

- **One-Stop Accounting 📚**: All the number-crunching happens on one blockchain, making updates seamless.

- **Liquidity Central 🏦**: By pooling all the liquidity in one place, the hub model makes for a smoother user experience.


#### 🛠️ **Workflow of Protocol Operations** 🛠️

1. **Meet & Greet the Spoke 🤝**: First off, you've got to introduce your spoke contracts to the hub. This is like getting a VIP pass that lets you deposit assets into the spoke, which the hub then acknowledges.

2. **The Deposit Dance 💃**: Users can deposit assets from different chains into the hub, making it the go-to place for all things financial.

3. **Borrow & Payback Time ⏳**: Once you've got your assets in the hub, you can borrow from various chains. And of course, what you borrow, you must return!
