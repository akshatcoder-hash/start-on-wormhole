Hub is the place where assets are deposited, borrowed, and repaid. 

🛠️ **Step 1- Create Your Contract File:** 🛠️

First things first! Create a new file named `Hub.sol` in your `src/` directory. This is where all the action happens!

**Step 2**: Kick things off by adding the license and the libraries you'll need. Paste the following code:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity ^0.8.13;
import "wormhole-solidity-sdk/WormholeRelayerSDK.sol";
```

Remember our [Cross Chain Mailbox](https://startonwormhole.vercel.app/automatic-relayers/intro/) tutorial? Yep, we're using `wormhole-solidity-sdk` again for those awesome cross-chain features! 🌉


**Step 3- Declare the Hub Contract: 🎨** Time to declare our Hub contract! 🎉 Add this code snippet:

```solidity
contract Hub is TokenSender, TokenReceiver {
   uint256 constant GAS_LIMIT = 250_000;
   enum Action {DEPOSIT, WITHDRAW, BORROW, REPAY}
```

Here, our `Hub` contract inherits from `TokenSender` and `TokenReceiver`. This aligns perfectly with the article's point about the hub being the central point for all token transactions. 🔄

**Step 4 - Map Out Deposits and Borrows: 🗺️** 
Let's create some mappings to keep tabs on user deposits and borrows. 🗺️

```solidity
   mapping(address => mapping(address => uint256)) public vaultDeposits;
   mapping(address => mapping(address => uint256)) public vaultBorrows;
```

This is like the hub's own little ledger, keeping track of all the assets. 📚


**Step 5 - Initialize the Contract: 🏗️** 
Now, let's set up the constructor to initialize our contract. 🛠️

```solidity
   constructor(address _wormholeRelayer, address _tokenBridge, address _wormhole)
   TokenBase(_wormholeRelayer, _tokenBridge, _wormhole)
   {}
```

**Step 6- Quoting Function: 📊** 
Add a function that estimates the cost of returning assets to a spoke. This is like the hub's own calculator! 🧮.

```solidity
function quoteReturnDelivery(uint16 spokeChain) public view returns (uint256 cost) 
{
uint256 deliveryCost;

(deliveryCost,) = wormholeRelayer.quoteEVMDeliveryPrice(spokeChain, 0, GAS_LIMIT);
cost = deliveryCost + wormhole.messageFee();
}
```

**Step 7- The Heart of the Hub: 🎛️** 
This function is the control center of the Hub. It's a bit long, but it's where the magic happens! 🌟

```solidity
function receivePayloadAndTokens(
    bytes memory payload,
    TokenReceived[] memory receivedTokens,
    bytes32 sourceAddress,
    uint16 sourceChain,
    bytes32 deliveryHash
) 
internal override onlyWormholeRelayer isRegisteredSender(sourceChain, sourceAddress) replayProtect(deliveryHash) 
{
    if (receivedTokens.length == 0) {
        (Action action, address user, address tokenHomeAddress, uint256 amount) = abi.decode(payload, (Action, address, address, uint256));
        address tokenAddressOnThisChain = getTokenAddressOnThisChain(sourceChain, toWormholeFormat(tokenHomeAddress));

        if (action == Action.BORROW || action == Action.WITHDRAW) {
            if (updateHubState(action, user, tokenAddressOnThisChain, amount)) {
                sendTokenToUser(user, sourceChain, sourceAddress, tokenAddressOnThisChain, amount);
            }
        }
    } else if (receivedTokens.length == 1) {
        TokenReceived memory receivedToken = receivedTokens[0];
        (Action action, address user) = abi.decode(payload, (Action, address));

        if (action == Action.DEPOSIT || action == Action.REPAY) {
            updateHubState(action, user, receivedToken.tokenAddress, receivedToken.amount);
        }
    }
}

```

This function is like the Swiss Army knife of our Hub contract. It handles deposits, withdrawals, borrows, and repayments. It's the real MVP, aligning with everything the article talks about. 🏆


**Step 8- Update the Hub State: 🔄** 
Now, let's add a function that updates the state of the Hub based on user actions. 🔄

```solidity
function updateHubState(Action action, address user, address wrappedTokenAddress, uint256 amount) 
internal returns (bool success) 
{
    uint256 currentHubBalance = IERC20(wrappedTokenAddress).balanceOf(address(this));

    if (action == Action.DEPOSIT) {
        vaultDeposits[user][wrappedTokenAddress] += amount;

    } else if (action == Action.WITHDRAW) {
        if (vaultDeposits[user][wrappedTokenAddress] < amount) return false;
        if (currentHubBalance < amount) return false;
        vaultDeposits[user][wrappedTokenAddress] -= amount;

    } else if (action == Action.BORROW) {
        if (currentHubBalance < amount) return false;
        vaultBorrows[user][wrappedTokenAddress] += amount;

    } else if (action == Action.REPAY) {
        if (vaultBorrows[user][wrappedTokenAddress] < amount) {
            vaultDeposits[user][wrappedTokenAddress] += amount - vaultBorrows[user][wrappedTokenAddress];
            vaultBorrows[user][wrappedTokenAddress] = 0;
        } else {
            vaultBorrows[user][wrappedTokenAddress] -= amount;
        }
    }

    return true;
}
```

This function is like the hub's personal assistant, updating records and making sure everything is in tip-top shape! 📋



**Step 9- Close the Contract 🎉** You've made it to the end! Don't forget to close the contract with a `}`. 🎉
