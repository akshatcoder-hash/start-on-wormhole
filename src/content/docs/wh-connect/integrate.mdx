Alright, you've got a basic React App up and running. Now it's time to sprinkle in some Wormhole Connect SDK magic to kickstart your token bridging journey. 🌉✨

## 🌟 Initializing Wormhole Connect SDK 🌟

First things first, let's initialize the Wormhole Connect SDK within our **Bridge** app directory.

In your app's root directory, go ahead and install the Wormhole Connect SDK with the following command:

```bash
npm i @wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect
```

## 🛠️ Crafting the Bridge 🛠️

Now, navigate to your `src/App.tsx` file and clear out its contents.

### 📦 Importing the SDK 📦

Start by importing the Wormhole Connect SDK into your React App. Simply add this line at the top of your file:

```tsx
import WormholeBridge from "@wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect";
```


### 🎨 Building the App Function 🎨

Once the SDK is imported, let's create a function that renders the bridge element we just imported. Add the following code snippet: 

```tsx
function App() {
  return (
    <WormholeBridge />
  );
}
```

This should go right below your import statements.

### 🏁 The Final Lap: Exporting the Function 🏁

To render the `App` function on your webpage, you'll need to export it. Add this line at the end of your code:

```tsx
export default App;
```

If you've been following along, your code should look something like this:

```tsx
import WormholeBridge from '@wormhole-foundation/wormhole-connect';

function App() {
  return (
    <WormholeBridge />
  );
}

export default App;
```

Save your changes, and your local server at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) should display something like this:

🎉 Woohoo! You've successfully built your very own token bridge, all thanks to the power of Wormhole. Feel free to bridge tokens and acquire wrapped assets on your network of choice.
