In this segment, we're going to walk you through the process of building a token bridge using Wormhole Connect. We'll kick things off by crafting a React web application from the ground up and then weave in Wormhole Connect to facilitate cross-chain operations. Ready to dive in? 🏊‍♀️

  

## 🛠️ Setting Up Your React App 🛠️

  

First on the agenda is to whip up a basic React web application. We'll be using TypeScript for added robustness. Fire up your terminal and execute the following command:

  

```bash

npx create-react-app bridge --template typescript

```

  

This will conjure up a simple React web application named **Bridge**, complete with TypeScript support.

Here's what your output will look like:

## 🚀 Launching Your React App 🚀

Congratulations, you've successfully spawned a React App! Now, let's open it up in an editor—VS Code is my go-to—and get it running on your local development server.

First, navigate into the directory where your React app resides:

  
```bash

cd bridge

```


Next, pop open the directory in VS Code and fire up the Local Development Server with this command:

```bash
code . && npm run start
```

This will not only open your project in a VS Code window but also kickstart your React app on your local server. To see your app in action, head over to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in your web browser.

And there you have it! Your React app is up and running, ready for the next steps. 🌟
